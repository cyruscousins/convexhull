<h1>A Delightful Sampling of Convex Hull Algorithms</h2>
<p>Experience the wonders of three time honored convex hull algorithms, including the Graham Scan, the Jarvis March, and the Kirkpatrick Seidel Ultimate Planar Convex Hull algorithms.

Instructions:<p>
Enter a pointset, using the mouse or in text format in the option panel.  The randomize, form regular poly, and form star poly buttons can be used to modify and create pointsets.  <p>
Make sure the pointset is in general position (but cocircular points are ok), and contains no 2 points on a vertical line.  Use the check degeneracy and fix degeneracy buttons to detect these and fix them automatically.  <p>
Once a pointset has been entered, select an algorithm (Jarvis, Graham, or Kirkpatrick Seidel), and use the control buttons (located on the bottom right) to run through the algorithm.  <p>
To visualize the cost of each operation, select the "Complexity Analysis Report" tab on the lower panel.  <p>
