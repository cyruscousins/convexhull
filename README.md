This repository contains the work I (Cyrus Cousins) did for a computational geometry class taught by Greg Aloupis at Tufts University in Spring 2013.

The project is a java applet with a visual representation designed to explain the Jarvis March, Graham Scan, and Kirkpatrick Siedel convex hull algorithms, as well as to produce a detailed report of the complexity and time cost of the various steps of each algorithm.
